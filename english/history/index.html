        <h2>Ancient origins (before the 19th century)</h2>
        <p>Football can trace its roots back to ball games. These games have been played in various cultures throughout history.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient China</strong> : The game known as ‘cuju’, meaning ‘to kick the ball’, was played during the Han dynasty with rules similar to modern football, but played with a leather ball.</li>
            <li><strong>Ancient Greece and Rome</strong> : Games such as ‘Harpastum’, a kind of ball game with rules similar to scrimmage, were played.</li>
            <li><strong>The Middle Ages</strong> : In Europe, ball games were played in villages, often without precise rules and with matches involving hundreds of players.</li>
        </ul>
