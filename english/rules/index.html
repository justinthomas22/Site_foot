    <h2>The bases</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li>Match duration:  And 	football match lasts 90 minutes, which takes place in two parts called “two halves” which each last 45 minutes, with a 15 minute break between the two which is not included in the 90min of games</li>
            <li>Objective : Score more goals than the opponent by sending the ball into the opponent's goal. Whoever has the most goals wins the match.</li>
            <li>Number of players: Each team has 11 players on the field, including a goalkeeper. So 10 on the field of play and the goalkeeper</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h2>The main rules</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>The ball in play and out of play</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ball is "in play" as long as he has not completely crossed the sidelines or goal lines.</li>
            <li>The ball is "offside" when it crosses completely these lines.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Offside at player level</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A player is considered “offside” when he is between the last defender and the goalkeeper and receives the ball from a teammate of his. Offside is not counted if the person attacking is in their part of the field.</li>
            <li>If the attacker is in position and it is an opponent who passes him, “offside” is not taken into account because it is not 	not his teammate who passes him.</li>
            <li>It is not an offense to be in an offside position unless the player is primarily involved in the action.</li>
        </ul>

            <img src="assets/img/horsjeux.jpg" class="videohj"></a>
<h3>Mistakes and behavior antisportif</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A foul is called when a player pushes, charges, hits, or plays dangerously.</li>
    <li>Unsportsmanlike behavior (protests, simulation, etc.) may result in warnings (yellow card) or expulsion (red card). If the same player receives two yellow cards in the same match he automatically receives a red card so he is excluded and his team plays with 10, the player is not allowed to be replaced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Playing with hands</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only the guardian can use 	his hands, and only in his penalty area. Other players cannot touch the ball with their hands or arms intentionally, otherwise they will be punished depending on how it happened</li>
